<h3>Hashing Computation Notes</h3>
<p><hr size="1">
<p>This directory contains scripts and files used to verify that the hashing program
   hashfile creates the correct md5, sha1 and sha256 hashes.

<p>The hashing algorithms implemented in the program hashfile are verified by computing 
    the md5, sha1 and sha256 hashes for the file named <tt>base</tt> and comparing the result to the
    reference hashes saved in the file named <tt>reference</tt>.  The results in <tt>reference</tt>
    were verified by computing the hashes for the file base and comparing them to
    results found using the online calculator located at
