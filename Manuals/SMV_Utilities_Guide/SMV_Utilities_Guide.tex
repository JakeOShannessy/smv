\chapter{Introduction}

Several utilities are included with FDS and Smokeview allowing one
to more easily analyze simulated data.  
For example, Smokezip is used to compress FDS data files resulting in smaller file sizes and quicker Smokeview load times.  
Smokediff is used to compare two FDS cases with essentially the same geometry showing the affect of small changes in one or both of these cases.  
Smokediff take as input two .smv files.  It then generates a differenced slice and boundary file for each slice and boundary file shared by these two cases.
These differenced files can then be viewed in Smokeview.  
Background is used to take advantage of multiple
core computers by running multiple FDS cases simultaneously.  This is most useful when running
a long list of FDS cases on a computer that does not have a queuing system. Background runs a case whenever the CPU load is below a specified level.
Dem2fds is used to generate FDS input files for cases  containing terrain.
Elevation data obtained from a USGS website is converted to blockages.

Several scripts, firebot, smokebot and cfastbot, are used to verify various components of FDS, Smokeview and CFAST.
Bourne shell versions of these scripts run on Linux and OSX systems and DOS batch file versions run on the PC.  These scripts obtain the latest version of the
software from a Git repository, build the software, run test cases and perform various types of checks.
These scripts are valuable at catching errors early in the development process.

\chapter{Summary}
Often fire modeling is looked upon with skepticism because of the
perception that eye-catching images shroud the underlying physics.
However, if the visualization is done well, it can be used to
assess the quality of the simulation technique. The user of FDS
chooses a numerical grid on which to discretize the governing
equations. The more grid cells, the better but more time-consuming
the simulation. The payoff for investing in faster computers and
running bigger calculations is the proportional gain in calculation accuracy and realism
manifested by the images. There is no better way to demonstrate
the quality of the calculation than by showing the realistic
behavior of the fire.

Up to now, most visualization techniques have provided useful ways
of analyzing the output of a calculation, like contour and
streamline plots, without much concern for realism. A
rainbow-colored contour map slicing down through the middle of a
room is fine for researchers, but for those who are only
accustomed to looking at real smoke-filled rooms, it may not have
as much meaning. Good visualization needs to provide as much
information as the rainbow contour map but in a way that speaks to
modelers and non-modelers alike. A good example is smoke
visibility. Unlike temperature or species concentration, smoke
visibility is not a local quantity but rather depends on the
viewpoint of the eye and the depth of field. Advanced simulators
and games create the illusion of smoke or fog in ways that are not
unlike the techniques employed by fire models to handle thermal
radiation. The visualization of smoke and fire by Smokeview is an
example of the graphics hardware and software actually computing
results rather than just drawing pretty pictures. A common concern
in the design of smoke control systems is whether or not building
occupants will be able to see exit signs at various stages of a
fire. FDS can predict the amount of soot is located at any given
point, but that doesn't answer the question. The harder task is to
compute on the fly within the visualization program what the
occupant would see and not see. In this sense, Smokeview is not
merely a {\em post-processor}, but rather an integral part of the
analysis.

The purpose of Smokeview is to help one gain insight into the results
of fire modeling simulations.
Some areas of future work pertaining to the technical aspects of
Smokeview include improving the visual modeling of smoke and fire
and improving Smokeview's ability to handle larger cases.
General strategies for improving Smokeview's ability to visualize
cases and therefore to improve the understanding of computed fire
flow are discussed in more detail in the
Smokeview Technical Guide~\cite{Smokeview_Tech_Guide}.
